Main package for SOM and PLSOM implementations.<br>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

SOM and PLSOM both extend the MapBaseImpl class.<br>

MapBaseImpl implements the MapBase interface, which declares some
common methods. MapBaseImpl defines these methods<br>

and implements some methods for useful tasks and reading/writing XML
files.<br>

<br>

Usage example, PLSOM:<br>

<pre>
 //create a new PLSOM with 2 input dimensions, 2 output dimensions and 2500 nodes.
 PLSOM plsom = new PLSOM(2,50,50);
 //set the neighbourhood range of the PLSOM
 plsom.setNeighbourhoodRange(60);
 //create a variable to hold training data.
 double [] tmp = new double[2];
 Random r = new Random(1);
 //train the PLSOM with 2000 random inputs
 for ( int x = 0;x&lt; 2000;x++ )
 {
   //generate random input
   tmp[0] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
   tmp[1] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
   //train the PLSOM, thus updating the weights.
   plsom.train(tmp);
 }
 //test the PLSOM
 tmp[0] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
 tmp[1] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
 plsom.setInput(tmp);
 int [] p = plsom.classify();
 //print the location of the winning node
 System.err.println("Input [" + tmp[0]+","+tmp[1]+"] maps to node ["+ p[0]+","+p[1]+"]");

</pre>

The SOM class is used in a similar way, but requires a<span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span>SOMTrainer object to train it.
<br>
<pre>	
 //create a new SOM with 2 input dimensions, 2 output dimensions and 2500 nodes. 
 SOM som = new SOM(2,w,h);	
 //create a variable to hold training data.
 double [] tmp = new double[2];
 Random r = new Random(1);
 //create the SOMTrainer default implementation to train the SOM
 SOMTrainer somTrainer = new SOMTrainer(som);
 //set the SOMTrainer parameters
 somTrainer.setLearningRate(0.8);
 somTrainer.setNeighbourhoodSize(60);
 //train the SOM with 2000 random inputs
 for ( int x = 0;x&lt; count;x++ )
 {
   //generate random input
   tmp[0] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
   tmp[1] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
   //train the SOM, thus updating the weights
   somTrainer.setInput(tmp);
 }
 //test the SOM
 tmp[0] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
 tmp[1] = r.nextDouble()*2-1;
 som.setInput(tmp);
 int [] p = som.classify();
 //print the location of the winning node
 System.err.println("Input [" + tmp[0]+","+tmp[1]+"] maps to node ["+ p[0]+","+p[1]+"]");
</pre>

<big>A word about metrics.</big><br>
Self-Organizing Maps (both SOM and PLSOM) require metrics. Metrics in
this context is a method for measuring the distance between two points
in <br>
either input space (to measure the distance between inputs and weight
vectors) or output space (to measure the distance between nodes).<br>
These measures are realized by classes in the org.plsomlib.metrics
package which implement the InputMetric and OutputMetric interfaces.
Abstract implementations of these interfaces, InputMetricImpl and
OutputMetricImpl, are provided to simplify subclassing.<br>
These classe provide functionality for XML serialization and deserialization.<br>
<br>
There are also default implementations that can be used to create a map
with euclidean input and output spaces and a nodes arranged in a
rectangular grid, EuclideanInputMetric and
RectangularEuclideanOutputMetric.<br>
<br>
<big>Neighbourhood functions.</big><br>
Furthermore, SOMs require a neighbourhood function to calculate the interaction between nodes during training.<br>
These functions are realized by classes in the
org.plsomlib.neighbourhood package that implement the
NeighbourhoodFunction interface.<br>
An abstract implementation, NeighbourhoodFunctionImpl, which provides
XML serialization and deserialization is provided to simplify
subclassing.<br>
A default implementation providing a Gaussian neighbourhood function is
also provided, in the class GaussianNeighbourhoodFunction.<br>
<br>
<big>JUnit tests.</big><br>
The<span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span>MainTestCase class provides JUnit testing.<br>
