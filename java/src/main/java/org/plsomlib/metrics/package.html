Provides extensible metrics for use by SOMs and PLSOMs.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>Self-Organizing Maps (both SOM and PLSOM) require
metrics. <br>
Metrics in this context is a method for measuring the distance
between two points in <br>
either input space (to measure the distance
between inputs and weight vectors) or output space (to measure the
distance between nodes).<br>
These measures are realized by classes in
the org.plsomlib.metrics package which implement the Metric interface.
An abstract implementation of this interface, MetricImpl, is provided in order to simplify
subclassing.<br>
These classes must provide functionality for XML serialization and deserialization.<br>
<br>
There
is also a default implementation that can be used to create a map with
euclidean input and output spaces and a nodes arranged in a rectangular
grid, EuclideanMetric.<br>
