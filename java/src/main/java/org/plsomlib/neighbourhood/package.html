This package defines neighbourhood functions.<br>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Neighbourhood functions determine how much the nodes close to the winning node are affected by a weight update.<br>
These functions are realized by classes that implement the NeighbourhoodFunction interface.<br>
There is an abstract implementation
available, NeighbourhoodFunctionImpl, which also provides basic XML
serialization/deserialization funcionality.<br>
A default implementation providing a Gaussian neighbourhood
function is also provided, in the class GaussianNeighbourhoodFunction.<br>
